Software engineering is a lot more about right **mindset**
than about technology, e;ven though technology is important part of a puzzle.

Future posts will be about technology.
Reference Linus Torvalds and Richard Feynman and Albert Ainstain.

Asking questions. Engneers think that other people are in most cases wrong. They have big egos. That actually helps them to be succesfull, even though it has bad sides.

I will try to expose both personal experiences and experiences accumulated from observing successful engineers in my environment.

In order to get on a right track, we need to ask ourselves
why are we here? What we want to accomplish?
What brings **quality** to software?

Quality is a pretty abstract word.
What does it mean? Can we define it in simpler manner?
Let's try with a car metaphor. We all like cars. Especially German cars.
Ask yourself why? What features your dream car must have?

Picture of a car here

What if i put down these equations:

Quality = Logic + Personality

Logic = Durability + Performance + Efficiency

Personality = Curiosity + Excitement + Persistance

Curiosity = Awareness(Reflection) + Continious Improvement

Iterative, Increments
They always thinks how to break stuff. Excellent excercise: Go out there and try to break other people's sites....

Let me to explain myself...

## Durability

> Durable things do not get broken under pressure.

You certainly do not want to think about these kind of things:

    - Am I driving this car too much?

    - What is the road like? Is it too bumpy?

    - What if it starts to rain? Will the car's color get washed up?

    - Will my seats get used up after extensive seating?

The same kind of questions are asked about software all the time!
You need to **design** your software for every possible user input or context in which it might end up. Really good software engineers never assume things. They always verify things.

If you are just getting started, there are a lot of internal and external factors which might go wrong when building any kind of software.

I will list few of them for each category.

Internal factors:

External factors:

Out of the box thinking.

Exercise:
Logic and truth tables

## Performance

Performance meters.

But, that's not the only reason we like German cars.
We like them because they are performant.
Why performance metter?

# Efficiency

How useful is speed of a car, if it takes whole sallary out of your pocket?

Techniques engineers use to reduce cost of building software...
